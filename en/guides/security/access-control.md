# Access Control

This guide explains how to implement access control in AACSearch to manage user permissions and secure your search resources.

## Introduction

Access control is a critical security mechanism that determines who can access specific resources, perform actions, or view data within AACSearch. By setting up proper access control, you can protect sensitive information, prevent unauthorized modifications, and ensure that users only interact with the parts of your search system they are permitted to. This guide covers how to configure and manage access control in AACSearch.

## Accessing Access Control Settings

1. **Navigate to Account Settings**: From the sidebar menu in the dashboard, select "Account" or "Settings."
2. **Go to Team or Permissions Section**: In the account settings, find the "Team," "Users," or "Permissions" tab to manage access control.
3. **Configure Roles and Permissions**: Define roles, assign users to roles, and set permissions for accessing indexes, dashboards, or API operations.

## Understanding Access Control

- **Purpose**: Access control restricts access to AACSearch resources (e.g., indexes, analytics, settings) based on user identity, role, or permissions to maintain security and data integrity.
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: A common model where permissions are assigned to roles, and users are assigned to roles, simplifying management for teams.
- **Granularity**: Access control can be applied at various levels, such as entire indexes, specific operations (e.g., read, write), or even individual data fields.

## Setting Up Access Control

1. **Define Roles**:

   - **Create Roles**: In the permissions section, create roles that reflect common user responsibilities (e.g., "Admin," "Editor," "Viewer").
   - **Assign Permissions**: Set specific permissions for each role, such as read access to search results, write access to update indexes, or admin access to manage settings.
   - **Follow Least Privilege**: Grant only the minimum permissions needed for a role to perform its tasks to reduce security risks.

2. **Manage Users**:

   - **Invite Team Members**: Add users to your AACSearch account by sending invitations via email through the "Team" or "Users" section.
   - **Assign Roles to Users**: Link each user to one or more roles to inherit the associated permissions, ensuring they can only access what they need.
   - **Multi-Role Support**: If supported, assign multiple roles to a user for complex permission needs (e.g., "Editor" for one index, "Viewer" for another).

3. **Control Index Access**:

   - **Index-Level Permissions**: Restrict access to specific indexes by role or user, ensuring users can only interact with authorized datasets (e.g., a marketing team only sees marketing indexes).
   - **Operation Restrictions**: Limit operations on indexes (e.g., allow searching but not updating) to prevent unauthorized changes to data or configurations.
   - **Temporary Access**: If needed, provide temporary access to specific indexes or resources for limited-time tasks, revoking it afterward.

4. **API Access Control**:
   - **API Key Permissions**: Tie API keys to specific roles or permissions to control what API operations can be performed (see [API Key Management](../security/api-keys.md)).
   - **Token-Based Access**: If AACSearch supports OAuth or JWT tokens, use them for more secure and granular API access control, especially for third-party integrations.
   - **Scoped API Access**: Limit API keys or tokens to specific indexes or actions to minimize damage if credentials are compromised.

## Best Practices for Access Control

- **Regularly Review Permissions**: Periodically audit roles, users, and permissions to ensure they align with current team responsibilities and organizational policies.
- **Remove Unused Access**: Revoke access for users who no longer need it (e.g., former employees, completed projects) to prevent lingering vulnerabilities.
- **Use Strong Authentication**: Enforce strong passwords and, if supported, enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) for user accounts to protect against unauthorized logins.
- **Segregate Duties**: Separate critical functions across different roles (e.g., one role for managing data, another for analytics) to reduce the risk of misuse or errors.
- **Document Policies**: Maintain clear documentation of access control policies and roles to ensure consistency and facilitate onboarding of new team members.

## Monitoring Access Control

- **Track User Activity**: Use AACSearch's audit logs or activity tracking (if available) to monitor who accesses what resources and when, helping detect unauthorized access.
- **Set Alerts for Suspicious Activity**: Configure alerts for unusual login patterns or permission changes to respond quickly to potential security issues.
- **Review Access Logs**: Regularly check access logs to ensure compliance with policies and identify any anomalies or breaches.

## Testing Access Control

- **Validate Permissions**: Test roles by logging in as different users or using API keys with specific permissions to confirm they can only perform authorized actions.
- **Attempt Unauthorized Access**: Try accessing restricted resources or performing restricted actions to ensure access control mechanisms block unauthorized attempts.
- **Iterate Based on Feedback**: Adjust roles or permissions based on testing results or user feedback to address gaps or overly restrictive settings.

## Advanced Access Control Techniques

- **Custom Roles via API**: Use the AACSearch API to programmatically define and manage custom roles or permissions for automated security workflows.
- **Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)**: If supported, implement ABAC to control access based on user attributes (e.g., department, location) for finer-grained policies.
- **Integration with Identity Providers**: Connect AACSearch to external identity providers (e.g., SSO with Okta, Azure AD) for centralized user management and authentication.

## Troubleshooting

- **Access Denied Errors**: If users can't access resources, verify their assigned role and permissions, ensure the resource exists, and check for typos in configurations.
- **Overly Restrictive Permissions**: If legitimate users are blocked from necessary tasks, review role definitions and adjust permissions to balance security and usability.
- **Unauthorized Access**: If unauthorized access occurs, revoke affected credentials, review logs to identify the breach source, and update access policies to prevent recurrence.
- **Contact Support**: For complex access control issues or integration challenges, reach out to support via [community.aacsearch.com](https://community.aacsearch.com) or email support@aacsearch.com.
