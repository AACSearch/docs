# Caching Strategies

This guide explores caching strategies in AACSearch to improve search performance by reducing query latency and server load.

## Introduction

Caching is a powerful technique for enhancing search performance by storing frequently accessed data or query results for quick retrieval. AACSearch supports various caching mechanisms to help you deliver faster search experiences while minimizing resource usage. This guide covers effective caching strategies to optimize your search implementation.

## Accessing Caching Settings

1. **Navigate to Indexes**: From the sidebar menu in the dashboard, select "Indexes."
2. **Select an Index**: Click on the index you want to configure.
3. **Go to Performance Settings**: In the index details, find the "Performance" or "Settings" tab to access caching configurations.

## Understanding Caching

- **Cache Purpose**: Caching stores precomputed results or data so that subsequent requests for the same information can be served faster without reprocessing.
- **Cache Levels**: Caching can occur at different levels, including query results, API responses, or even frontend UI components.
- **Cache Invalidation**: The process of updating or clearing cached data when the underlying data changes to ensure users see accurate results.

## Benefits of Caching

- **Reduced Latency**: Cached results are returned much faster than executing a full search query, improving user experience.
- **Lower Server Load**: By serving cached data, you reduce the number of queries hitting the search engine, conserving server resources.
- **Improved Scalability**: Caching helps handle traffic spikes by offloading repetitive requests from the search backend.

## Caching Strategies in AACSearch

1. **Query Result Caching**:

   - **Enable Query Caching**: Turn on caching for frequent or complex queries in the AACSearch dashboard to store their results for a defined period.
   - **Set Cache Duration**: Define how long query results remain cached (e.g., 5 minutes, 1 hour) based on how often your data changes.
   - **Cache by Query Parameters**: Ensure cache keys account for query parameters (e.g., search term, filters) to avoid serving incorrect cached results.

2. **API Response Caching**:

   - **Cache API Responses**: Use AACSearch API settings or a middleware layer to cache responses for common API calls (e.g., search endpoints, facet aggregations).
   - **Conditional Caching**: Cache responses only for queries with high repetition and stable results, avoiding caching for highly dynamic or personalized searches.
   - **Edge Caching**: Implement caching at the edge (e.g., via a CDN) for API responses to reduce latency for geographically distributed users.

3. **Frontend Caching**:

   - **Browser Cache**: Leverage browser caching headers (e.g., Cache-Control) for static search UI elements or API responses to minimize redundant requests.
   - **Local Storage**: Store recent search results or autocomplete suggestions in the user's browser local storage for instant retrieval during their session.
   - **State Management**: Use frontend state management libraries (e.g., Redux, Vuex) to cache search states or results within the application layer.

4. **Custom Caching with Middleware**:
   - **Proxy Layer**: Set up a proxy or middleware (e.g., Redis, Memcached) between your application and AACSearch to cache results based on custom logic.
   - **Selective Caching**: Cache only specific types of queries or results (e.g., popular searches, static data) while bypassing cache for real-time or user-specific queries.
   - **Cache Invalidation Rules**: Define rules in your middleware to invalidate cache entries when data updates occur (e.g., via webhooks or API notifications).

## Managing Cache Invalidation

- **Time-Based Invalidation**: Set expiration times (TTL - Time To Live) for cached data to automatically refresh after a certain period.
- **Event-Based Invalidation**: Use AACSearch webhooks or API events to invalidate cache entries when data is updated, added, or deleted in the index.
- **Manual Invalidation**: Provide a mechanism in your application or dashboard to manually clear caches when immediate updates are needed (e.g., after a major data revision).

## Monitoring Cache Effectiveness

- **Cache Hit Ratio**: Track the percentage of requests served from cache versus those requiring a full query to measure caching effectiveness.
- **Latency Reduction**: Monitor query response times with and without caching to quantify performance improvements.
- **Cache Size and Eviction**: Keep an eye on cache storage usage and eviction rates to ensure your cache isn't overfilled or evicting useful data too soon.

## Testing Caching Strategies

- **Simulate User Traffic**: Test caching under realistic user loads to ensure cached results are served correctly and performance gains are achieved.
- **Validate Data Freshness**: Verify that cache invalidation works as expected by updating data and checking if users see the latest results after cache refresh.
- **Iterate Based on Metrics**: Adjust cache duration, scope, or invalidation rules based on performance metrics and user feedback to optimize the balance between speed and accuracy.

## Advanced Caching Techniques

- **Personalized Caching**: Cache results with user-specific keys (e.g., user ID or session ID) to provide personalized results while still benefiting from caching.
- **Predictive Caching**: Use machine learning or analytics to predict and pre-cache results for likely queries based on user behavior patterns.
- **Multi-Layer Caching**: Combine browser, middleware, and AACSearch-level caching for a comprehensive strategy that maximizes hit rates at every level.

## Troubleshooting

- **Stale Data**: If users see outdated results, check cache invalidation rules and ensure expiration times or event triggers are set correctly.
- **Low Cache Hit Rate**: If caching isn't effective, review query patterns to ensure you're caching the right data (e.g., frequent, stable queries) and adjust cache keys for better matches.
- **Cache Overload**: If cache storage fills up too quickly, reduce cache duration, limit cached items, or implement least-recently-used (LRU) eviction policies.
