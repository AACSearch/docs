# Scaling

This guide covers strategies for scaling your AACSearch implementation to handle growing data volumes, user traffic, and performance demands.

## Introduction

Scaling is the process of adapting your search system to accommodate increased data, user activity, or performance requirements. AACSearch provides tools and configurations to help you scale effectively, ensuring fast and reliable search experiences even as your needs grow. This guide explores scaling strategies to maintain performance under high load.

## Accessing Scaling Settings

1. **Navigate to Indexes**: From the sidebar menu in the dashboard, select "Indexes."
2. **Select an Index**: Click on the index you want to configure.
3. **Go to Performance Settings**: In the index details, find the "Performance" or "Settings" tab to access scaling-related configurations.

## Understanding Scaling Challenges

- **Data Growth**: As your dataset increases, indexing and search operations can become slower without proper scaling.
- **Traffic Spikes**: High user traffic, especially during peak times, can overload servers and degrade search performance.
- **Resource Constraints**: Limited CPU, memory, or storage can bottleneck performance if not scaled appropriately.

## Scaling Strategies in AACSearch

1. **Vertical Scaling (Scaling Up)**:

   - **Upgrade Resources**: Increase the capacity of your AACSearch plan to access more powerful servers with higher CPU, memory, and storage limits.
   - **Optimize Single Index**: For smaller setups, focus on optimizing a single index with efficient configurations before distributing data.
   - **Monitor Limits**: Keep track of resource usage in the dashboard to know when vertical scaling is necessary to handle current loads.

2. **Horizontal Scaling (Scaling Out)**:

   - **Distribute Indexes**: Split large datasets into multiple smaller indexes based on categories, regions, or time periods to distribute load across resources.
   - **Use Multi-Index Search**: Configure AACSearch to search across multiple indexes simultaneously, balancing load while maintaining a unified search experience.
   - **Replicas for Redundancy**: Create replicas of your indexes to distribute read traffic (search queries) across multiple nodes, improving speed and fault tolerance.

3. **Data Partitioning**:

   - **Shard by Relevance**: Partition data into shards based on usage patterns (e.g., frequently accessed data in one shard, archival data in another) to optimize performance.
   - **Time-Based Partitioning**: For time-sensitive data, create separate indexes for different time ranges (e.g., current month, past year) to keep active data lean.
   - **Geo-Partitioning**: If serving global users, partition data by geographic region to reduce latency by routing queries to the nearest data center.

4. **Load Balancing**:
   - **Distribute Query Load**: Use AACSearch's built-in load balancing or external tools to evenly distribute search queries across available resources.
   - **Prioritize Critical Queries**: Implement query prioritization to ensure high-priority searches (e.g., paid users, critical operations) are processed faster during peak loads.
   - **Rate Limiting**: Apply rate limiting to prevent abuse or overloading from specific users or sources, protecting overall system performance.

## Managing Scaling Operations

- **Incremental Scaling**: Scale gradually by adding resources or partitions as needed, rather than over-provisioning upfront, to control costs.
- **Automated Scaling**: If supported by your AACSearch plan, enable automated scaling to dynamically adjust resources based on traffic or data volume.
- **Data Migration**: When splitting or repartitioning indexes, use AACSearch tools or APIs to migrate data without downtime, ensuring a seamless transition.

## Monitoring Scaling Performance

- **Track System Metrics**: Monitor CPU, memory, storage, and query latency in the AACSearch dashboard to identify scaling needs or bottlenecks.
- **Analyze Traffic Patterns**: Use analytics to understand peak usage times and user growth trends to plan scaling proactively.
- **Set Alerts**: Configure alerts for resource thresholds or performance degradation to respond quickly to scaling issues.

## Testing Scaling Strategies

- **Stress Test**: Simulate high traffic or data growth scenarios to test how your scaling setup handles load and identify weak points.
- **Measure Performance Impact**: Compare query response times and system stability before and after scaling changes to ensure improvements.
- **Iterate Based on Results**: Adjust scaling configurations based on test outcomes and real-world usage to find the optimal balance of performance and cost.

## Advanced Scaling Techniques

- **Hybrid Scaling**: Combine vertical and horizontal scaling for a balanced approachâ€”upgrade resources for critical components while distributing less urgent data across multiple indexes.
- **Custom Sharding Logic**: Use the AACSearch API to implement custom sharding or partitioning logic tailored to your specific data and usage patterns.
- **Global Distribution**: For international audiences, leverage AACSearch's multi-region support to replicate indexes across data centers worldwide, minimizing latency.

## Troubleshooting

- **Performance Bottlenecks**: If scaling doesn't improve performance, check for unoptimized queries or indexing issues that may be the root cause, not just resource limits.
- **Uneven Load Distribution**: If some nodes or indexes are overloaded, verify load balancing configurations and ensure data is partitioned evenly.
- **Downtime During Scaling**: If scaling operations cause interruptions, use replicas or staged migrations to maintain availability, and schedule major changes during low-traffic periods.
