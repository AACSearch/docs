# Query Optimization

This guide provides strategies for optimizing search queries in AACSearch to achieve faster response times and more relevant results.

## Introduction

Query optimization is essential for delivering a fast and effective search experience. Well-optimized queries reduce latency, minimize server load, and ensure users receive the most relevant results. This guide covers techniques to fine-tune your search queries in AACSearch for maximum performance and user satisfaction.

## Accessing Query Settings

1. **Navigate to Indexes**: From the sidebar menu in the dashboard, select "Indexes."
2. **Select an Index**: Click on the index you want to configure.
3. **Go to Search Configuration**: In the index details, find the "Search Configuration" tab or section to access query-related settings.

## Understanding Query Performance

- **Query Latency**: The time it takes for a search query to return results, influenced by query complexity, index size, and server load.
- **Relevance vs. Speed**: Balancing the depth of search (for better relevance) with response time (for better performance).
- **Resource Usage**: Complex queries can consume significant CPU and memory, impacting overall system performance.

## Best Practices for Query Optimization

1. **Simplify Query Structure**:

   - **Use Specific Fields**: Limit searches to specific fields (e.g., search only in "title" and "description") rather than all indexed data to reduce processing time.
   - **Avoid Overly Broad Queries**: Narrow down queries with filters or facets before executing a full-text search to minimize the dataset being searched.
   - **Reduce Wildcards**: Avoid excessive use of wildcard characters (e.g., "\*" or "?") at the start of terms, as they can significantly slow down searches.

2. **Leverage Filters and Facets**:

   - **Pre-Filter Data**: Apply filters (e.g., category, date range) before the main search to reduce the number of documents scanned.
   - **Use Facets Efficiently**: Retrieve facet data only when necessary and limit the number of facet values returned to avoid overhead.
   - **Combine Filters**: Use logical operators (AND, OR) to combine multiple filters in a single query rather than executing multiple separate queries.

3. **Optimize Pagination**:

   - **Limit Results Per Page**: Set a reasonable number of results per page (e.g., 10-20) to avoid fetching excessive data in one request.
   - **Use Cursor-Based Pagination**: For deep pagination, use cursor-based or offset-based pagination to efficiently navigate through large result sets.
   - **Cache Pagination Data**: Cache frequently accessed pages or result counts to reduce redundant query execution.

4. **Fine-Tune Relevance Settings**:
   - **Adjust Ranking Weights**: Prioritize fields most relevant to user intent (e.g., give higher weight to "title" over "content") to reduce unnecessary computation on less important matches.
   - **Disable Unneeded Features**: Turn off features like typo tolerance or synonym expansion for queries where exact matches are critical and speed is paramount.
   - **Use Query Rules**: Implement query rules to rewrite or redirect specific queries for faster processing (e.g., redirect common misspellings directly).

## Monitoring Query Performance

- **Track Query Latency**: Use analytics in the AACSearch dashboard to monitor average query response times and identify slow queries.
- **Analyze Query Patterns**: Review frequent or complex queries in analytics to spot optimization opportunities (e.g., queries with no results or high latency).
- **Log Slow Queries**: Enable logging for slow queries to diagnose specific performance issues and understand their root causes.

## Testing Query Optimization

- **Benchmark Queries**: Test query performance before and after optimization using realistic user scenarios and data volumes.
- **Simulate Peak Load**: Run stress tests during peak usage simulations to ensure optimized queries perform well under heavy traffic.
- **Iterate Based on Feedback**: Continuously refine queries based on user search behavior and performance metrics to maintain optimal speed and relevance.

## Advanced Query Optimization Techniques

- **Query Caching**: Cache frequently executed queries or query results using AACSearch's caching options to avoid redundant processing.
- **Query Rewriting via API**: Use the AACSearch API to programmatically rewrite inefficient queries before execution (e.g., simplify complex user inputs).
- **Machine Learning Optimization**: Leverage AACSearch's machine learning capabilities to automatically optimize query relevance and performance over time based on user interactions.

## Troubleshooting

- **Slow Query Response**: If queries are slow, check for overly broad search terms, excessive wildcard usage, or large result sets; apply filters or limit fields searched.
- **Irrelevant Results**: If optimized queries sacrifice relevance, review ranking weights and ensure key fields are prioritized appropriately.
- **High Server Load**: If queries cause spikes in resource usage, reduce result set sizes, batch requests, or consider upgrading your plan for more capacity.
