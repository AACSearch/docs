# Indexing Best Practices

This guide provides best practices for indexing data in AACSearch to ensure optimal search performance and efficient data management.

## Introduction

Indexing is a critical component of search performance. Proper indexing strategies ensure that your data is organized efficiently, allowing AACSearch to return results quickly even with large datasets. This guide covers best practices for indexing to maximize speed, minimize resource usage, and maintain high relevance in search results.

## Accessing Indexing Settings

1. **Navigate to Indexes**: From the sidebar menu in the dashboard, select "Indexes."
2. **Select an Index**: Click on the index you want to configure.
3. **Go to Index Settings**: In the index details, find the "Settings" tab or section to access indexing configurations.

## Understanding Indexing

- **Index Structure**: An index is a data structure that organizes your content for fast retrieval based on search queries.
- **Indexing Process**: The process of adding, updating, or deleting data in the index to reflect changes in your dataset.
- **Performance Impact**: Efficient indexing reduces query latency and improves the user experience, while poor indexing can lead to slow searches and increased resource consumption.

## Best Practices for Indexing

1. **Optimize Data Structure**:

   - **Flatten Nested Data**: Simplify nested or hierarchical data structures to reduce indexing complexity (e.g., convert nested JSON objects into flat key-value pairs where possible).
   - **Remove Unnecessary Fields**: Only index fields that are relevant to search or filtering; exclude irrelevant or rarely used data to reduce index size.
   - **Use Appropriate Data Types**: Ensure fields are indexed with the correct data type (e.g., numbers as integers or floats, not strings) to enable efficient sorting and filtering.

2. **Batch Updates**:

   - **Group Updates**: Instead of updating the index for every single change, batch multiple updates into a single operation to minimize overhead.
   - **Schedule Bulk Indexing**: For large datasets, perform bulk indexing during off-peak hours to avoid impacting search performance for active users.
   - **Use Delta Updates**: Only reindex changed data rather than the entire dataset to save time and resources.

3. **Manage Index Size**:

   - **Limit Indexed Content**: Avoid indexing excessively large text fields in full; use summaries or excerpts for long content and store full text elsewhere if needed.
   - **Purge Old Data**: Regularly remove outdated or irrelevant data from the index to keep it lean and focused on current content.
   - **Partition Large Indexes**: For very large datasets, consider splitting data into multiple smaller indexes based on categories, regions, or time periods to improve performance.

4. **Configure Indexing Settings**:
   - **Selective Indexing**: Choose which fields to index for search, filtering, or faceting based on user needs (e.g., index product names for search but not internal IDs).
   - **Asynchronous Indexing**: Enable asynchronous indexing if supported, allowing updates to process in the background without blocking other operations.
   - **Error Handling**: Set up notifications or logs for indexing failures to quickly address data ingestion issues.

## Monitoring Indexing Performance

- **Track Indexing Time**: Monitor how long it takes to index data, especially during bulk operations, to identify bottlenecks.
- **Check Index Health**: Use dashboard tools or API endpoints to verify the status and health of your indexes (e.g., ensure no data is stuck in a pending state).
- **Analyze Resource Usage**: Keep an eye on CPU, memory, and storage usage during indexing to ensure your infrastructure can handle the load.

## Testing Indexing Strategies

- **Simulate Load**: Test indexing performance with realistic data volumes and update frequencies to understand how your setup scales.
- **Measure Impact on Search**: After changing indexing configurations, run search performance tests to ensure query speed and relevance aren't negatively affected.
- **Iterate**: Refine indexing practices based on performance metrics and user feedback to continuously improve efficiency.

## Advanced Indexing Techniques

- **Custom Indexing Rules**: Use the AACSearch API to define custom indexing logic for specific use cases, such as prioritizing certain data or applying transformations during indexing.
- **Distributed Indexing**: For enterprise setups, distribute indexing tasks across multiple nodes or servers to handle massive datasets more efficiently.
- **Real-Time Indexing**: Implement real-time or near-real-time indexing for dynamic content (e.g., live feeds, user-generated content) while balancing performance trade-offs.

## Troubleshooting

- **Indexing Delays**: If data isn't appearing in search results, check for indexing queues or errors in the dashboard, and ensure your batch size isn't too large.
- **High Resource Usage**: If indexing consumes too many resources, reduce batch sizes, schedule operations during low-traffic periods, or upgrade your plan for more capacity.
- **Incomplete Data**: If some data fails to index, verify the data format and schema compatibility, and review error logs for specific issues.
