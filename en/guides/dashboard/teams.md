# Team Management

This guide covers how to manage team access and permissions in the AACSearch Dashboard, enabling collaboration on search projects.

## Introduction

If you're working with a team or managing multiple users, AACSearch allows you to organize collaboration through team management features. You can invite team members, assign roles, and control access to specific indexes and settings directly from the dashboard.

## Accessing Team Settings

1. **Navigate to Team**: From the sidebar menu in the dashboard, select "Team" or "Organizations" (depending on your account setup).
2. **View Team Members**: See a list of current team members and their roles.
3. **Manage Invitations**: Check pending invitations and resend or revoke them as needed.

## Inviting Team Members

1. **Invite New Member**: Click the "Invite Member" button.
2. **Enter Email**: Provide the email address of the person you want to invite.
3. **Assign Role**: Choose a role for the new member (e.g., Admin, Editor, Viewer).
4. **Send Invitation**: Click "Send Invite." The recipient will receive an email with instructions to join your team.

## Managing Roles and Permissions

- **Admin**: Full access to all features, including billing, API keys, and team management.
- **Editor**: Can manage indexes, search configurations, and data but cannot access billing or team settings.
- **Viewer**: Read-only access to view indexes, analytics, and search results without making changes.
- **Custom Roles**: For enterprise accounts, create custom roles with specific permissions tailored to your needs.

## Editing Team Member Access

1. **Select Member**: From the team list, click on a member's name or settings icon.
2. **Change Role**: Update their role or permissions as needed.
3. **Remove Member**: If necessary, remove a member from the team. They will lose access to all associated resources.

## Organization Management

- **Create Organization**: Group team members under an organization for better project management.
- **Switch Organizations**: If you're part of multiple organizations, switch between them from the dashboard menu.
- **Organization Settings**: Configure organization-wide settings like branding or default permissions.

## Best Practices for Team Collaboration

- **Define Clear Roles**: Assign roles based on each member's responsibilities to avoid conflicts or unauthorized changes.
- **Limit Admin Access**: Reserve admin roles for trusted individuals who need full control over account settings.
- **Regularly Review Access**: Periodically check team membership and update roles as team dynamics change.
- **Use Organizations for Scale**: For larger teams, use organizations to segment projects or departments.

## Troubleshooting

- **Invitation Issues**: If a team member doesn't receive an invitation, ask them to check their spam folder or resend the invite.
- **Access Problems**: Ensure the member's role grants the necessary permissions for the tasks they're trying to perform.
- **Contact Support**: For complex issues, reach out to support via [community.aacsearch.com](https://community.aacsearch.com) or email support@aacsearch.com.
