# Analytics & Insights

This guide explains how to use the analytics tools in the AACSearch Dashboard to gain insights into search performance and user behavior.

## Introduction

Understanding how users interact with your search functionality is crucial for optimizing their experience. AACSearch provides detailed analytics and insights through the dashboard, helping you track search queries, measure performance, and identify areas for improvement.

## Accessing Analytics

1. **Navigate to Analytics**: From the sidebar menu in the dashboard, select "Analytics."
2. **Select Time Range**: Choose a time period for the data you want to analyze (e.g., last 7 days, last month).
3. **View Dashboard**: The analytics dashboard displays key metrics and visualizations for your search activity.

## Key Metrics

- **Search Volume**: Total number of search queries made over the selected time period.
- **Top Queries**: Most frequently searched terms or phrases by your users.
- **No Results Queries**: Searches that returned no results, indicating potential gaps in your data or indexing.
- **Click-Through Rate (CTR)**: Percentage of searches where users clicked on a result.
- **Average Response Time**: How quickly your search responds to user queries, impacting user experience.

## Search Performance

- **Relevance Score**: Evaluate how relevant search results are based on user interactions (clicks, time spent on results).
- **Query Distribution**: See how queries are distributed across different categories or facets if applicable.
- **Device & Platform**: Analyze search usage across devices (mobile, desktop) and platforms (web, app).

## User Behavior

- **User Journey**: Track how users refine their searches (e.g., applying filters, modifying queries).
- **Engagement Metrics**: Measure how often users interact with search results (clicks, scrolls, subsequent searches).
- **Abandonment Rate**: Percentage of searches where users left without interacting with results.

## Custom Reports

- **Create Custom Reports**: Define specific metrics or filters to focus on particular aspects of search usage.
- **Export Data**: Download analytics data as CSV or PDF for further analysis or sharing with your team.
- **Scheduled Reports**: Set up automated reports to be emailed to you or your team on a regular basis.

## Using Insights for Improvement

- **Optimize Relevance**: Use top queries and no-results data to adjust ranking rules or add synonyms.
- **Improve Performance**: Address slow response times by optimizing index settings or scaling resources.
