# Relevance Tuning

This guide explains how to tune the relevance of search results in AACSearch to ensure users find the most pertinent content quickly.

## Introduction

Relevance is the cornerstone of an effective search experience. AACSearch provides powerful tools to customize how search results are ranked and displayed, allowing you to prioritize the most relevant content for your users based on their queries and your business goals.

## Accessing Relevance Settings

1. **Navigate to Indexes**: From the sidebar menu in the dashboard, select "Indexes."
2. **Select an Index**: Click on the index you want to configure.
3. **Go to Search Configuration**: In the index details, find the "Search Configuration" tab or section, then look for "Relevance" or "Ranking" settings.

## Understanding Relevance Factors

- **Textual Relevance**: How closely the content of a document matches the user's query (e.g., exact matches, partial matches).
- **Attribute Weighting**: Assign higher importance to certain fields (e.g., title over description) when determining relevance.
- **Custom Business Rules**: Incorporate business logic, such as promoting popular or trending items, into the ranking.

## Configuring Ranking Rules

1. **Define Searchable Attributes**: Specify which fields in your data (e.g., title, content, tags) should be considered during a search.
2. **Set Attribute Weights**: Assign weights to prioritize certain fields. For example, a match in the title might be weighted higher than a match in the description.
3. **Add Custom Ranking Criteria**: Include additional factors like "popularity" or "recency" to influence result ordering.
4. **Save Changes**: Apply your settings and test the impact on search results.

## Using Tie-Breaking Rules

- **Set Tie-Breakers**: When multiple results have similar relevance scores, define secondary criteria (e.g., date, price) to break ties.
- **Order Tie-Breakers**: Prioritize tie-breaking rules to ensure consistent result ordering.

## Personalization and Context

- **User Context**: Adjust relevance based on user-specific data, such as location or past search history, if available.
- **Query Context**: Consider the intent behind a query (e.g., informational vs. transactional) to adjust result ranking.
- **Dynamic Re-Ranking**: Use machine learning models or user feedback to dynamically adjust rankings over time.

## Testing and Optimization

- **Search Preview**: Use the dashboard's search preview tool to see how different queries return results with your current relevance settings.
- **Analyze Analytics**: Review analytics to identify queries with low click-through rates or no results, indicating relevance issues.
- **Iterate**: Continuously refine your relevance settings based on user behavior and feedback to improve search quality.

## Advanced Relevance Tuning

- **Custom Algorithms**: For advanced users, implement custom ranking algorithms via API to handle complex use cases.
- **A/B Testing**: Run experiments with different relevance configurations to determine which performs best for your audience.
- **Machine Learning**: Leverage AACSearch's machine learning capabilities to automatically optimize relevance based on user interactions.

## Best Practices

- **Start Simple**: Begin with basic attribute weighting before moving to complex custom rules.
- **Know Your Users**: Understand what your users value most in search results (e.g., recency, accuracy) to guide relevance tuning.
- **Monitor Performance**: Regularly check analytics to ensure relevance settings are meeting user needs.
- **Document Changes**: Keep track of relevance adjustments to understand their impact over time.

## Troubleshooting

- **Irrelevant Results**: If users see irrelevant results, check attribute weights and ensure key fields are prioritized.
- **Missing Results**: Verify that all relevant fields are marked as searchable and that data is fully indexed.
- **Inconsistent Ranking**: Review tie-breaking rules to ensure consistent ordering of similar results.
