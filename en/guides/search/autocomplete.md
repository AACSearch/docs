# Autocomplete

This guide explains how to set up and manage autocomplete functionality in AACSearch to help users find content faster by suggesting search terms as they type.

## Introduction

Autocomplete, also known as type-ahead or search-as-you-type, predicts and suggests search terms or phrases based on the user's input in real-time. AACSearch provides powerful tools to implement autocomplete, enhancing user experience by reducing typing effort and guiding users to relevant content quickly.

## Accessing Autocomplete Settings

1. **Navigate to Indexes**: From the sidebar menu in the dashboard, select "Indexes."
2. **Select an Index**: Click on the index you want to configure.
3. **Go to Search Configuration**: In the index details, find the "Search Configuration" tab or section, then look for "Autocomplete" or "Query Suggestions" settings.

## Understanding Autocomplete

- **Query Suggestions**: Suggestions based on popular or trending search terms within your index.
- **Completion Suggestions**: Suggestions that complete the user's partial input based on indexed content (e.g., suggesting "smartphone" when the user types "smart").
- **Dynamic Results**: As users type, autocomplete can display not just terms but also direct results or previews of matching content.

## Setting Up Autocomplete

1. **Enable Autocomplete**: In the Autocomplete settings, toggle the feature on for your index.
2. **Configure Suggestion Sources**:
   - **Indexed Content**: Base suggestions on the actual data in your index (e.g., titles, keywords).
   - **Query History**: Use historical search data to suggest popular queries.
   - **Custom Suggestions**: Manually define a list of terms or phrases to suggest, useful for promotions or key content.
3. **Set Display Options**:
   - **Number of Suggestions**: Limit how many suggestions appear to avoid overwhelming users (e.g., 5-10 suggestions).
   - **Delay and Trigger**: Set the typing delay or minimum characters before suggestions appear (e.g., after 3 characters or 200ms pause).
   - **Categories**: Group suggestions into categories (e.g., "Products," "Categories") if applicable.
4. **Save Changes**: Apply your settings to update the index with the new autocomplete configuration.

## Customizing Autocomplete Behavior

- **Highlight Matches**: Highlight the matching portion of suggestions to show users how their input relates to the suggestion.
- **Personalization**: Tailor suggestions based on user context, such as location or past searches, if supported by your setup.
- **Filter Suggestions**: Restrict suggestions to specific fields or facets (e.g., only suggest product names, not descriptions).

## Integrating Autocomplete in UI

- **Autocomplete Widgets**: Use AACSearch SDKs or components (e.g., JavaScript SDK, React components) to integrate autocomplete into your search bar or interface.
- **Custom Styling**: Style the suggestion dropdown to match your application's design, ensuring a seamless user experience.
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Enable users to navigate suggestions using keyboard arrows and select with Enter for accessibility.

## Testing Autocomplete

- **Search Preview**: Use the dashboard's search preview tool to test autocomplete suggestions with different partial queries.
- **Analyze Analytics**: Monitor analytics to see how often users interact with autocomplete suggestions and whether they lead to successful searches.
- **Iterate**: Adjust autocomplete settings based on user behavior to prioritize the most useful suggestions.

## Best Practices

- **Keep Suggestions Relevant**: Ensure suggestions are closely tied to user intent by prioritizing high-quality indexed content or popular queries.
- **Optimize Speed**: Autocomplete should respond instantly; minimize suggestion latency by limiting the number of results or caching common queries.
- **Avoid Clutter**: Display a concise list of suggestions to prevent decision fatigue; focus on the most likely matches.
- **Support Multi-Language**: If your search supports multiple languages, configure autocomplete to suggest terms in the user's language.

## Advanced Autocomplete Usage

- **API-Driven Suggestions**: Use the AACSearch API to fetch autocomplete suggestions programmatically for custom interfaces or real-time needs.
- **Custom Ranking**: Define custom logic for ranking autocomplete suggestions beyond default relevance (requires advanced setup).
- **Machine Learning**: Leverage machine learning to improve suggestion accuracy over time based on user interactions.

## Troubleshooting

- **No Suggestions Appearing**: Ensure autocomplete is enabled and that there is sufficient indexed content or query history to generate suggestions.
- **Irrelevant Suggestions**: Check the source of suggestions (e.g., indexed fields, custom list) and refine to focus on relevant data.
- **Slow Response**: If suggestions load slowly, reduce the number of suggestions or optimize the index for faster lookups.
- **Contact Support**: For complex autocomplete issues, reach out to support via [community.aacsearch.com](https://community.aacsearch.com) or email support@aacsearch.com.
