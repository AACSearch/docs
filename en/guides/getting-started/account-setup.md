# Account Setup

Welcome to AACSearch! This guide will walk you through the process of setting up your account to start using our powerful search platform. Whether you're a developer, business owner, or content creator, creating an account is the first step to integrating advanced search capabilities into your applications or websites.

## Step 1: Sign Up for an Account

To begin, you need to create an AACSearch account. Follow these steps:

1. **Visit the AACSearch Website**: Go to [https://www.aacsearch.com](https://www.aacsearch.com).
2. **Click on Sign Up**: Locate the "Sign Up" button on the homepage, usually found in the top right corner.
3. **Fill Out the Registration Form**: Provide the required information, including:
   - Your full name
   - Email address (this will be used for account verification and notifications)
   - Password (ensure it's strong and secure)
   - Organization name (optional, but helpful for team accounts)
4. **Accept Terms and Conditions**: Review our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy, then check the box to accept them.
5. **Submit the Form**: Click "Create Account" to complete the registration process.

After submitting, you will receive a confirmation email. Click the link in the email to verify your account.

## Step 2: Log In to Your Account

Once your email is verified, you can log in to your AACSearch account:

1. **Go to the Login Page**: Navigate to [https://dashboard.aacsearch.com](https://dashboard.aacsearch.com).
2. **Enter Your Credentials**: Input your email address and password.
3. **Access Your Dashboard**: Click "Log In" to enter the AACSearch Dashboard, where you can manage your search indexes and settings.

## Step 3: Set Up Your Profile

Completing your profile helps us tailor your experience and ensures smooth collaboration if you're part of a team:

1. **Navigate to Profile Settings**: From the dashboard, click on your avatar or name in the top right corner and select "Profile Settings."
2. **Update Personal Information**: Add or update details such as your profile picture, contact information, and timezone.
3. **Configure Notifications**: Choose how you want to receive updates (email, in-app notifications) for account activity, billing, and search analytics.
4. **Save Changes**: Click "Save" to update your profile.

## Step 4: Create or Join an Organization (Optional)

If you're working with a team or managing multiple projects, setting up an organization is recommended:

1. **Go to Organizations**: From the dashboard menu, select "Organizations."
2. **Create a New Organization**: Click "Create Organization," enter a name, and invite team members by email.
3. **Join an Existing Organization**: If you've been invited to an organization, accept the invitation from your email or dashboard notifications.
4. **Set Permissions**: As an organization admin, configure roles and permissions for team members to control access to indexes and settings.

## Step 5: Generate API Keys

To integrate AACSearch with your application, you'll need API keys for authentication:

1. **Access API Keys**: From the dashboard, navigate to "API Keys" under "Settings."
2. **Create a New API Key**: Click "Generate New Key," give it a descriptive name (e.g., "Production Key"), and set permissions (e.g., read-only for analytics, full access for indexing).
3. **Copy and Store Securely**: Once generated, copy the API key and store it securely. You won't be able to view it again after closing the dialog.
4. **Use in Your Application**: Include the API key in your application requests as a header (`X-API-Key: your-api-key`). See [API Quickstart](../../api/quickstart.md) for integration examples.

## Step 6: Explore the Dashboard

Take a moment to familiarize yourself with the AACSearch Dashboard:
